# ichain

ICHAIN, currently on **[ichain.io](http://ichain.io)** is a decentralized solution for storing media images (possibly videos as well). Ichain is designed to work either on a [local](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/testing_contracts_and_transactions.html) [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) chain ( see more details  [here](https://souptacular.gitbooks.io/ethereum-tutorials-and-tips-by-hudson/content/private-chain.html) ) or a [public](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/geth) [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) chain. There is also a potential to use ichain with other chains in the future such as the [Bicoin Blockchain](http://bitcoin.org) or the [Namecoin Blockchain](http://namecoin.org/)but for now the focus is on *Ethereum* only.

Due to extremly *high costs* for adding data intro the Blockchain trough [Smart Contracts](http://ethereum.org/greeter) etc, only **hashes** ( **[md5](http://www.freeformatter.com/message-digest.html) hashes** to be more exact ) of images will be saved into the main chain and possibly small thumbnails into the private blockchain.
